    <h2>About OneONN</h2>
    <p>
      OneONN stands at the forefront of intelligent systems innovation, reimagining how neural networks interact with the real world. Our mission is to rewrite intelligence from the ground up — not by mimicking the brain, but by understanding how machines can adapt, evolve, and protect in a world of data chaos. 

      Our proprietary neural technologies — ONN-Flow™, SecureNode™, and NeuroGraph™ — form a triad of capability: dynamic adaptability, fortified intelligence, and scalable learning. With a combined research lineage of over 15 years in AI, cybersecurity, and distributed systems, OneONN brings together a global team of researchers, data scientists, and engineers unified under one goal: to create an AI layer that doesn't just learn — it defends, decentralizes, and evolves in real-time.

      Whether you’re building autonomous transportation systems or defending national networks, OneONN’s stack is designed to thrive in complexity. Our work is trusted by institutions, enterprises, and frontier labs across four continents. Welcome to intelligence, rewritten.

        <h3>ONN-Flow™</h3>
        <p>
          ONN-Flow™ is OneONN’s adaptive learning engine capable of real-time gradient shifts, dynamic feedback loops, and resource-optimized neural pathways. Designed for environments that shift by the second — from high-speed trading to battlefield simulations — ONN-Flow™ delivers outcomes faster than traditional supervised systems. It learns at the edge, corrects in the cloud, and iterates without human intervention.
        </p>

      <div class="module">
        <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>
        <h3>SecureNode™</h3>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity is no longer reactive. SecureNode™ embeds AI-native protection into every model endpoint, detecting adversarial attacks, zero-day exploits, and hidden injection patterns before they manifest. This isn’t antivirus — this is real-time neural defense, baked into the computation graph.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="module">
        <i class="fas fa-project-diagram"></i>
        <h3>NeuroGraph™</h3>
        <p>
          NeuroGraph™ maps large-scale AI behavior across distributed clusters. Think of it as a neural blueprint that shows not only what’s happening, but why. From debugging to optimization, NeuroGraph™ visualizes AI cognition across time and space, helping engineers and AI ethicists alike understand neural causality.
